The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that builds upon the Factory Pattern by providing an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It acts like a "factory of factories," allowing you to create different sets of related objects based on a chosen theme or product family.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts involved:

- **Abstract Factory:** An interface that defines methods for creating different product types within a family (e.g., createShape(), createWidget()). It doesn't specify the concrete product classes, but just their creation functionalities.
- **Concrete Factory:** A subclass of the abstract factory that implements the creation methods for a specific family of related products. Each concrete factory creates concrete product objects that belong to the same family and work together cohesively.
- **Product:** An interface or base class defining the common functionality of a product type within a family. Concrete product classes implement this interface and provide specific functionalities.

**Benefits of Abstract Factory Pattern:**

- **Promotes Consistent Object Families:** By using a dedicated factory for each product family, you ensure that only compatible products from the same family are created together, promoting consistency and avoiding compatibility issues.
- **Improved Flexibility:** You can easily switch between different product families by choosing the appropriate concrete factory, making the code more adaptable to different requirements.
- **Decoupling Creation from Usage:** Similar to the Factory Pattern, the client code doesn't need to know about specific product classes, just the abstract factory interface, promoting loose coupling.

**Here's an analogy to understand the Abstract Factory Pattern:**

Imagine a furniture store (abstract factory) that has separate departments (concrete factories) for different types of furniture (product families) like bedroom (bed, nightstand) or living room (sofa, coffee table). Each department (factory) creates products (furniture) that belong to the same family and are designed to work well together. You can choose the department (factory) based on the furniture set (product family) you need.

**C++ Example:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Product interfaces (base classes for families)
class Shape {
public:
  virtual void draw() const = 0;
};

class Widget {
public:
  virtual void show() const = 0;
};

// Concrete product classes (families)
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
  void draw() const override {
    std::cout << "O" << std::endl;
  }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
  void draw() const override {
    std::cout << "-----\n|   |\n|   |\n-----\n" << std::endl;
  }
};

class Button : public Widget {
public:
  void show() const override {
    std::cout << "Button" << std::endl;
  }
};

class Dial : public Widget {
public:
  void show() const override {
    std::cout << "Dial" << std::endl;
  }
};

// Abstract factory interface
class UIFactory {
public:
  virtual std::unique_ptr<Shape> createShape() const = 0;
  virtual std::unique_ptr<Widget> createWidget() const = 0;
};

// Concrete factories (for different UI themes)
class ClassicUIFactory : public UIFactory {
public:
  std::unique_ptr<Shape> createShape() const override {
    return std::make_unique<Circle>();
  }

  std::unique_ptr<Widget> createWidget() const override {
    return std::make_unique<Button>();
  }
};

class ModernUIFactory : public UIFactory {
public:
  std::unique_ptr<Shape> createShape() const override {
    return std::make_unique<Square>();
  }

  std::unique_ptr<Widget> createWidget() const override {
    return std::make_unique<Dial>();
  }
};

int main() {
  UIFactory* factory = new ClassicUIFactory();

  std::unique_ptr<Shape> shape = factory->createShape();
  shape->draw(); // Output: O

  std::unique_ptr<Widget> widget = factory->createWidget();
  widget->show(); // Output: Button

  delete factory;

  // You can create a Modern UI set using a different factory
  factory = new ModernUIFactory();
  // ... (use factory methods to create modern UI elements)

  delete factory;

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` and `Widget` interfaces represent product families. The `
